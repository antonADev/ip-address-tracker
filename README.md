## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - For state and data fetching
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've improved the understanding of RTK because I've switched to it after learning the core consepts of Redux. Understood better how the data flows between the Redux State and the components.
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

Next step is to improve my skills with React and use RTK queries for data fetching and caching.
